# ArduinoProject1
Controlling a servo with a joystick via Arduino.
At this point, I'm finished with the project.
My accomplishments during this project have been:
1. Dynamically set a servo's position to the joystick input in somewhat low latency loop.
2. Set and LED to different colors depending on analog joystick input.
3. Play tones on a speaker depending on joystick input.
4. Display different patterns based on joystick inputs.
5. Attach 2 libraries to my project so everything would work.
6. Create loop conditionals to set a servo (0-90) value to joystick output (0-1024).
7. Determine appropriate bounds to set loop conditionals as my analog joystick had unique deadcenter values.
8. Upload all the code and have it work all together.
